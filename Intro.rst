==============

This document describes a range and bearing system developed by the METU Romer Robotics Center, led by Prof. Ali Emre Turgut, Mehmet Åžahin, and Muhammed Sezer. The system comprises eight VL53L5CX sensors, which are state-of-the-art, Time-of-Flight (ToF), multizone ranging sensors. They are integrated through an I2C interface to create a robust and efficient system for applications in robotics and automation.
